## Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics

Welcome to my solution and notes repository for Sussman and Wisdom's [The
Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics](https://amzn.to/2LUx62M).
You can get a copy of the book on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2LUx62M), or follow
along using this beautiful [HTML version](https://tgvaughan.github.io/sicm/).

## The Road to Reality

If you like this sort of thing, you might also consider subscribing to ["The
Road to Reality"](https://roadtoreality.substack.com/), a newsletter where I
post primers and lessons on interesting topics in math, physics, machine
learning or artificial intelligence, with a heavy emphasis on locking down the
intuition behind the ideas over mere symbol shuffling.

## Other SICM Resources

- [SICMUtils](https://github.com/sicmutils/sicmutils) a Clojure
  implementation of the `scmutils` / `mechanics` library.
- The [course website](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/) for
  MIT's 6.946, ["Classical Mechanics: A Computational
  Approach"](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/). This is a
  graduate level course in classical mechanics that uses this textbook. The
  course page has excellent materials, links to errata, all the goods.
- [Errata for the 2nd edition of
  SICM](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/errata.pdf). I've found
  some more, which I'll add to this page as I go.
- [The SICM Textbook on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2LUx62M)
- [Beautiful HTML version of the SICM
  Textbook](https://tgvaughan.github.io/sicm/). You have to read this!
- [MIT OpenCourseware page for the Fall 2008 version of the
  course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-620j-classical-mechanics-a-computational-approach-fall-2008/index.htm).
  This uses the first edition of the textbook. I haven't gone through this page
  in any detail.
